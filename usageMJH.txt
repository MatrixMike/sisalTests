 ./sisal function.sis  > sisalOut1.txt

The build {./configure , make } sequence does lots of work but throws errors - see error file.
However the compiler appears to start but needs tables in a specific location. 

sudo make install
the compiler is called sisalc and responds to --help   and -version    ...!

if exec from install folder and point it at a .sis file (e.g. in ~/sisalTests ) then it accepts the file - see hello.txt
